Put all your ideas for events the LUG could do here!

### Hack Night

A night to hang out and hack on Linux-related things.


### Intro to Linux Workshop

Get attendees to come along with a USB drive and a laptop, and walk them through what Linux is, how to flash onto a USB, and how to boot into it (and maybe for the few that do want to install it, installation!)
